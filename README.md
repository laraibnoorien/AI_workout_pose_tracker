# AI_workout_pose_tracker

The AI Workout Pose Detection Model is a real-time fitness assistant that helps users maintain proper workout form and prevent injuries. 
This model detects the human body, identifies key points, and calculates angles to determine if a workout pose is correct. 
It provides instant feedback and tracks repetitions for an accurate and effective workout experience.

Features

-> Real-time Pose Detection: Identifies key body points and tracks movement.

-> Angle Calculation: Analyzes joint angles to ensure correct posture.

-> Instant Feedback: Provides corrective guidance to maintain proper form.

-> Repetition Counter: Tracks the number of valid repetitions.

-> Support for Multiple Exercises: Adaptable to various workout types (e.g., squats, push-ups, lunges).




Technologies Used: Programming Language: Python

Frameworks & Libraries: 
-> OpenCV (Computer Vision)
-> Mediapipe (Pose Detection)
-> NumPy (Mathematical Computations)
-> TensorFlow/Keras (AI-based Enhancements)
-> PyGame (GUI Integration)



Installation

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed (>=3.7). 
Install the required dependencies using:

pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy tensorflow pygame



Usage: 

1. Run the Pose Detection Script:  python pose_detection.py

2. Perform Workout Moves

-> Stand in front of the camera and perform the exercise.
-> The model will detect your pose and provide real-time feedback.
-> It will count valid repetitions and alert you if the posture is incorrect.

How It Works

Body Keypoints Detection: The model uses MediaPipe to track key points such as shoulders, elbows, knees, etc.

Angle Computation: Calculates angles between joints to check if the form is correct.

Feedback System: Displays messages and suggestions based on detected posture.

Repetition Tracking: Counts only valid repetitions based on proper movement execution.


Example Output

Correct Pose: "Good job! Keep going."

Incorrect Pose: "Adjust your knee angle. Keep your back straight."

Reps Count: "Reps completed: 5"



Future Enhancements

Integration with AI models for more advanced feedback.

Support for additional workout types.

Mobile application version.

Voice-assisted feedback.

Workout plan suggestion based on goal, interests and healt issues if any
